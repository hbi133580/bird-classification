# bird-classification
CSE 455 final project: image classification using a neural network.
This is a short documentation of my process.

# Objective
Given an image of a bird, classify its species out of the 555 possible options. This project is my work for the Kaggle competition here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/birds21wi/

My personal goals were to:
- See how people actually code with neural networks in practice
- Learn some Python and Pytorch
- Get experience with a doing a lot of self-learning

# Setup
Before I could start, I needed to familiarize myself with the tools available. I went through some tutorials on using Kaggle, which is where I got the data, and Google Colab, which I used as my coding environment because it provides free GPU usage. I also spent a decent amount of time Python and Pytorch tutorials before starting because I didn't have any experience and learn better with some structure rather than just going in and trying things out.
